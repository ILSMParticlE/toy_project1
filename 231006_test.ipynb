(don't just comment it\n","out, because that can make the code difficult to read.)\n","\n","\n","there should be no busy waiting in your submission.  a tight loop that\n","calls thread_yield() is one form of busy waiting.\n","\n","\n","in the past, many groups divided the assignment into pieces, then each\n","group member worked on his or her piece until just before the\n","deadline, at which time the group reconvened to combine their code and\n","submit.  this is a bad idea.  we do not recommend this\n","approach.  groups that do this often find that two changes conflict\n","with each other, requiring lots of last-minute debugging.  some groups\n","who have done this have turned in code that did not even compile or\n","boot, much less pass any tests.\n","\n","\n","instead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often,\n","using a source code control system such as subversion, or\n","better yet git.\n","this is less likely to produce surprises, because everyone can see\n","everyone else's code as it is written, instead of just when it is\n","finished.  these systems also make it possible to review changes and,\n","when a change introduces a bug, drop back to working versions of code.\n","\n","\n","you should expect to run into bugs that you simply don't understand\n","while working on this and subsequent projects.  when you do,\n","reread the appendix on

section e.4 backtraces), which will help you to get the most out of every\n","kernel panic or assertion failure.\n","\n","\n","before you turn in your project, you must copy the\n","project 1 design document template into your source tree under the name\n","pintos/src/threads/designdoc and fill it in.  we recommend that\n","you read the design document template before you start working on the\n","project.  see section d. project documentation, for a sample design document\n","that goes along with a fictitious project.\n","\n","\n","reimplement timer_sleep(), defined in devices/timer.c.\n","although a working implementation is provided, it \"busy waits,\" that\n","is, it spins in a loop checking the current time and calling\n","thread_yield() until enough time has

time.\n","\n","timer_sleep() is useful for threads that operate in real-time,\n","e.g. for blinking the cursor once per second.\n","\n","\n","\n","the argument to timer_sleep() is expressed in timer ticks, not in\n","milliseconds or any another unit.  there are timer_freq timer\n","ticks per second, where timer_freq is a macro defined in\n","devices/timer.h.  the default value is 100.  we don't recommend\n","changing this value, because any change is likely to cause many of\n","the tests to fail.\n","\n","\n","\n","separate functions timer_msleep(), timer_usleep(), and\n","timer_nsleep() do exist for sleeping a specific number of\n","milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, respectively, but these will\n","call timer_sleep() automatically when necessary.  you do not need\n","to modify them.\n","\n","\n","if your delays seem too short or too long, reread the explanation of the\n","-r option to pintos (see section 1.1.4 debugging versus testing).\n","\n","\n","the alarm clock implementation is not needed for later projects,\n","although it could be useful for project 4.\n","\n","\n","implement priority scheduling in pintos.\n","when a thread is added to the ready list that has a higher priority\n","than the currently running thread, the current thread should\n","immediately yield the processor to the new thread.  similarly, when\n","threads are waiting for a lock, semaphore, or condition variable, the\n","highest priority waiting thread should be awakened first.  a thread\n","may raise or lower its own priority at any time, but lowering its\n","priority such that it no longer has the highest priority must cause it\n","to immediately yield the cpu.\n","\n","\n","thread priorities range from pri_min (0) to pri_max (63).\n","lower numbers correspond to lower priorities, so that priority 0\n","is the lowest priority and priority 63 is the highest.\n","the initial thread priority is passed as an argument to\n","thread_create().  if there's no reason to choose another\n","priority, use pri_default (31).  the pri_ macros are\n","defined in threads/thread.h, and you should not change their\n","values.\n","\n","\n","one issue with priority scheduling is \"priority inversion\".  consider\n","high, medium, and low priority threads h, m, and l,\n","respectively.  if h needs to wait for l (for instance, for a\n","lock held by l), and m is on the ready list, then h\n","will never get the cpu because the low priority thread will not get any\n","cpu time.  a partial fix for this problem is for h to \"donate\"\n","its priority to l while l is holding the lock, then recall\n","the donation once l releases (and thus h acquires) the lock.\n","\n","\n","implement priority donation.  you will need to account for all different\n","situations in which priority donation is required.  be sure to handle\n","multiple donations, in which multiple priorities are donated to a single\n","thread.  you must also handle nested donation: if h is waiting on\n","a lock that m holds and m is waiting on a lock that l\n","holds, then both m and l should be boosted to h's\n","priority.  if necessary, you may impose a reasonable limit on depth of\n","nested priority donation, such as 8 levels.\n","\n","\n","you must implement priority donation for locks.  you need not\n","implement priority donation for the other pintos synchronization\n","constructs.  you do need to implement priority scheduling in all\n","cases.\n","\n","\n","finally, implement the following functions that allow a thread to\n","examine and modify its own priority.  skeletons for these functions are\n","provided in threads/thread.c.\n","function: void thread_set_priority (int new_priority)\n","sets the current thread's priority to new_priority.  if the\n","current thread no longer has the highest priority, yields.\n","function: int thread_get_priority (void)\n","returns the current thread's priority.  in the presence of priority\n","donation, returns the higher (donated) priority.\n","\n","\n","you need not provide any interface to allow a thread to directly modify\n","other threads' priorities.\n","\n","\n","the priority scheduler is not used in any later project.\n","\n","\n","implement a multilevel feedback queue scheduler similar to the\n","4.4bsd scheduler to\n","reduce the average response time for running jobs on your system.\n","see section b. 4.4bsd scheduler, for detailed requirements.\n","\n","\n","like the priority scheduler, the advanced scheduler chooses the thread\n","to run based on priorities.  however, the advanced scheduler does not do\n","priority donation.  thus, we recommend that you have the priority\n","scheduler working, except possibly for priority donation, before you\n","start work on the advanced scheduler.\n","\n","\n","you must write your code to allow us to choose a scheduling algorithm\n","policy at pintos startup time.  by default, the priority scheduler\n","must be active, but we must be able to choose the 4.4bsd\n","scheduler\n","with the -mlfqs kernel option.  passing this\n","option sets thread_mlfqs, declared in threads/thread.h, to\n","true when the options are parsed by parse_options(), which happens\n","early in main().\n","\n","\n","when the 4.4bsd scheduler is enabled, threads no longer\n","directly control their own priorities.  the priority argument to\n","thread_create() should be ignored, as well as any calls to\n","thread_set_priority(), and thread_get_priority() should return\n","the thread's current priority as set by the

threads/thread.c.  the default is 4 ticks.\n","\n","\n","\n","we don't recommend changing this value, because any changes are likely\n","to cause many of the tests to fail.\n","\n","\n","\n","how do i run the tests?\n","\n","\n","see section 1.2.1 testing.\n","\n","\n","\n","why do i get a test failure in pass()?\n","\n","\n","you are probably looking at a backtrace that looks something like this:\n","\n","\n"," 0xc0108810: debug_panic (lib/kernel/debug.c:32)\n","0xc010a99f: pass (tests/threads/tests.c:93)\n","0xc010bdd3: test_mlfqs_load_1 (...threads/mlfqs-load-1.c:33)\n","0xc010a8cf: run_test (tests/threads/tests.c:51)\n","0xc0100452: run_task (threads/init.c:283)\n","0xc0100536: run_actions (threads/init.c:333)\n","0xc01000bb: main (threads/init.c:137)\n","\n","\n","this is just confusing output from the backtrace program.  it\n","does not actually mean that pass() called debug_panic().  in\n","fact, fail() called debug_panic() (via the panic()\n","macro).  gcc knows that debug_panic() does not return, because it\n","is declared no_return (see section e.3 function and parameter attributes), so it doesn't include any code in fail() to take\n","control when debug_panic() returns.  this means that the return\n","address on the stack looks like it is at the beginning of the function\n","that happens to follow fail() in memory, which in this case happens\n","to be pass().\n","\n","\n","\n","see section e.4 backtraces, for more information.\n","\n","\n","\n","how do interrupts get re-enabled in the new thread following schedule()?\n","\n","\n","every path into schedule() disables interrupts.  they eventually\n","get re-enabled by the next thread to be scheduled.  consider the\n","possibilities: the new thread is running in switch_thread() (but\n","see below), which is called by schedule(), which is called by one\n","of a few possible functions:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thread_exit(), but we'll never switch back into such a thread, so\n","it's uninteresting.\n","\n","\n","\n","thread_yield(), which immediately restores the interrupt level upon\n","return from schedule().\n","\n","\n","\n","thread_block(), which is called from multiple places:\n","\n","\n","\n","sema_down(), which restores the interrupt level before returning.\n","\n","\n","\n","idle(), which enables interrupts with an explicit assembly sti\n","instruction.\n","\n","\n","\n","wait() in devices/intq.c, whose callers are responsible for\n","re-enabling interrupts.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","there is a special case when a newly created thread runs for the first\n","time.  such a thread calls intr_enable() as the first action in\n","kernel_thread(), which is at the bottom of the call stack for every\n","kernel thread but the first.\n","do i need to account for timer values overflowing?\n","\n","\n","don't worry about the possibility of timer values overflowing.  timer\n","values are expressed as signed 64-bit numbers, which at 100 ticks per\n","second should be good for almost 2,924,712,087 years.  by then, we\n","expect pintos to have been phased out of the cs 140 curriculum.\n","doesn't priority scheduling lead to starvation?\n","\n","\n","yes, strict priority scheduling can lead to starvation\n","because a thread will not run if any higher-priority thread is runnable.\n","the advanced scheduler introduces a mechanism for dynamically\n","changing thread priorities.\n","\n","\n","\n","strict priority scheduling is valuable in real-time systems because it\n","offers the programmer more control over which jobs get processing\n","time.  high priorities are generally reserved for time-critical\n","tasks. it's not \"fair,\" but it addresses other concerns not\n","applicable to a general-purpose operating system.\n","\n","\n","\n","what thread should run after a lock has been released?\n","\n","\n","when a lock is released, the highest priority thread waiting for that\n","lock should be unblocked and put on the list of ready threads.  the\n","scheduler should then run the highest priority thread on the ready\n","list.\n","\n","\n","\n","if the highest-priority thread yields, does it continue running?\n","\n","\n","yes.  if there is a single highest-priority thread, it continues\n","running until it blocks or finishes, even if it calls\n","thread_yield().\n","if multiple threads have the same highest priority,\n","thread_yield() should switch among them in \"round robin\" order.\n","\n","\n","\n","what happens to the priority of a donating thread?\n","\n","\n","priority donation only changes the priority of the donee\n","thread.  the donor thread's priority is unchanged.  \n","priority donation is not additive: if thread a (with priority 5) donates\n","to thread b (with priority 3), then b's new priority is 5, not 8.\n","\n","\n","\n","can a thread's priority change while it is on the ready queue?\n","\n","\n","yes.  consider a ready, low-priority thread l that holds a lock.\n","high-priority thread h attempts to acquire the lock and blocks,\n","thereby donating its priority to ready thread l.\n","\n","\n","\n","can a thread's priority change while it is blocked?\n","\n","\n","yes.  while a thread that has acquired lock l is blocked for any\n","reason, its priority can increase by priority donation if a\n","higher-priority thread attempts to acquire l.  this case is\n","checked by the priority-donate-sema test.\n","\n","\n","\n","can a thread added to the ready list preempt the processor?\n","\n","\n","yes.  if a thread added to the ready list has higher priority than the\n","running thread, the correct behavior is to immediately yield the\n","processor.  it is not acceptable to wait for the next timer interrupt.\n","the highest priority thread should run as soon as it is runnable,\n","preempting whatever thread is currently running.\n","\n","\n","\n","how does thread_set_priority() affect a thread receiving donations?\n","\n","\n","it sets the thread's base priority.  the thread's effective priority\n","becomes the higher of the newly set priority or the highest donated\n","priority.  when the donations are released, the thread's priority\n","becomes the one set through the function call.  this behavior is checked\n","by the priority-donate-lower test.\n","\n","\n","\n","doubled test names in output make them fail.\n","\n","\n","suppose you are seeing output in which some test names are doubled,\n","like this:\n","\n","\n"," (alarm-priority) begin\n","(alarm-priority) (alarm-priority) thread priority 30 woke up.\n","thread priority 29 woke up.\n","(alarm-priority) thread priority 28 woke up.\n","\n","\n","what is happening is that output from two threads is being\n","interleaved.  that is, one thread is printing \"(alarm-priority)\n","thread priority 29 woke up.\\n\" and another thread is printing\n","\"(alarm-priority) thread priority 30 woke up.\\n\", but the first\n","thread is being preempted by the second in the middle of its output.\n","\n","\n","\n","this problem indicates a bug in your priority scheduler.  after all, a\n","thread with priority 29 should not be able to run while a thread with\n","priority 30 has work to do.\n","\n","\n","\n","normally, the implementation of the printf() function in the\n","pintos kernel attempts to prevent such interleaved output by acquiring\n","a console lock during the duration of the printf call and\n","releasing it afterwards.  however, the output of the test name,\n","e.g., (alarm-priority), and the message following it is output\n","using two calls to printf, resulting in the console lock being\n","acquired and released twice.\n","how does priority donation interact with the advanced scheduler?\n","\n","\n","it doesn't have to.  we won't test priority donation and the advanced\n","scheduler at the same time.\n","\n","\n","\n","can i use one queue instead of 64 queues?\n","\n","\n","yes.  in general, your implementation may differ from the description,\n","as long as its behavior is the same.\n","\n","\n","\n","some scheduler tests fail and i don't understand why.  help!\n","\n","\n","if your implementation mysteriously fails some of the advanced\n","scheduler tests, try the following:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","read the source files for the tests that you're failing, to make sure\n","that you understand what's going on.  each one has a comment at the\n","top that explains its purpose and expected results.\n","\n","\n","\n","double-check your fixed-point arithmetic routines and your use of them\n","in the scheduler routines.\n","\n","\n","\n","consider how much work your implementation does in the timer\n","interrupt.  if the timer interrupt handler takes too long, then it\n","will take away most of a timer tick from the thread that the timer\n","interrupt preempted.  when it returns control to that thread, it\n","therefore won't get to do much work before the next timer interrupt\n","arrives.  that thread will therefore get blamed for a lot more cpu\n","time than it actually got a chance to use.  this raises the\n","interrupted thread's recent cpu count, thereby lowering its priority.\n","it can cause scheduling decisions to change.  it also raises the load\n","average.\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["from urllib.request import urlopen\n","from bs4 import
